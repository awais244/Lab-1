## About My Favourite Paragraph 
Hi, my name is Awais. One of my favourite things I have written was a speech for my cousin's wedding. It was special because I shared stories from our childhood and reflected on the bond we have built over the years. In the speech, I talked about the joy of seeing my cousin find someone who truly complements them and how their relationship inspires everyone around them. I also added some lighthearted memories that brought laughter to the room, making it both sentimental and fun. 

The speech was well received, and I was touched by my cousin and their partner's warmth and appreciation. I often think back to that day, especially when I want to remind myself of the importance of love and family.
