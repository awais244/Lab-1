## About My Favourite Paragraph 
Hi, my name is Awais. One of my favourite things that I’ve written was a speech for my cousin's wedding. It was special because I got to share stories from our childhood and reflect on the bond we’ve built over the years. In the speech, I talked about the joy of seeing my cousin find someone who truly complements them, and how their relationship inspires everyone around them. I also added some lighthearted memories that brought laughter to the room, making it both sentimental and fun. 
The speech was well received, and I was really touched by the warmth and appreciation from both my cousin and their partner. I often think back to that day, especially when I want to remind myself of the importance of love and family.
